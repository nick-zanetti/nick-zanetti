## Welcome! :wave:

I am a web developer with experience in: Javascript, React, Redux, Vue.js, HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap, Firebase, Git, and other technologies here and there. 

I was recently a part of [Collab Lab's](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) Summer 2021 cohort. 

I am always looking for opportunities to learn cool things or work on awesome projects. Feel free to drop me a line at my email address on the left for these or if you just want to chat! 

You can check out my [personal website](https://nickzanetti.com/) for examples of my work or see the repositories below:
